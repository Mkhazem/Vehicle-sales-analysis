🚗 Vehicle Sales Performance & Pricing Strategy Analysis
📌 About This Project

This project analyzes over 500,000 vehicle sales records to evaluate revenue performance, pricing strategy, and regional behavior across U.S. states.

The goal was not just to build a dashboard — but to simulate a real business intelligence scenario for a nationwide dealership network and extract actionable insights.

🎯 What I Wanted to Understand

Which states generate the highest revenue?

Are vehicles being sold above or below market value (MMR)?

Is the business prioritizing volume or margin?

Are there regional pricing inconsistencies?

How does revenue evolve over time?
