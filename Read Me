🚗 Vehicle Sales Performance & Pricing Strategy Analysis

Power BI | DAX | Data Cleaning | Business Intelligence

📌 About This Project
This project analyzes over 500,000 vehicle sales records to evaluate revenue performance, pricing strategy, and regional behavior across U.S. states.
The goal was not just to build a dashboard — but to simulate a real business intelligence scenario for a nationwide dealership network and extract actionable insights.

📦 Project Scope

- Dataset Size: 545,000+ records  
- Geographic Coverage: United States  
- Analysis Focus: Revenue Performance & Pricing Strategy  
- Tool Environment: Power BI Desktop  

Data Source: Kaggle – Vehicle Sales Dataset

🎯 What I Wanted to Understand

Which states generate the highest revenue?
Are vehicles being sold above or below market value (MMR)?
Is the business prioritizing volume or margin?
Are there regional pricing inconsistencies?
How does revenue evolve over time?

🛠 Tools Used

Power BI
DAX
Power Query
Data Cleaning & Transformation
Business KPI Design

🧹 Data Preparation

The raw dataset contained:
545K+ rows
Missing brand values
Text-based date formats
Structurally corrupted state records

What I did:
Cleaned and standardized missing values
Removed invalid and corrupted rows
Converted string dates into proper date formats
Engineered new columns:
Sale Year
Sale Month
Price vs Market Difference
Pricing Category (Above / Below / At Market)

📊 Key Insights

1️⃣ Revenue Concentration
Revenue is heavily concentrated in a few key states such as Florida and California, indicating strong regional dominance.

2️⃣ Pricing Strategy
Over 50% of vehicles were sold below market value (MMR).
This suggests a volume-driven strategy rather than a premium pricing approach.

3️⃣ Regional Discount Behavior
Some states show significantly negative total price differences, indicating aggressive discounting, while others maintain more balanced pricing.
This reveals inconsistency in regional pricing governance.

4️⃣ Revenue Volatility
Monthly revenue trends show strong fluctuations, suggesting demand seasonality and potential operational volatility.

💡 Business Interpretation

The dealership appears to prioritize sales volume over per-unit margin.
While this increases revenue throughput, a sustained discount-driven strategy may compress long-term profitability.
Regional pricing strategy could be optimized to balance competitiveness with margin protection.

⚙ Challenges Faced

- Cleaning inconsistent string-based date formats  
- Identifying and removing structurally corrupted rows  
- Managing large dataset performance within Power BI  
- Designing pricing classification logic (Above / Below / At Market)
